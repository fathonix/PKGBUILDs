# PKGBUILDs
My own ports of some packages to Arch Linux

## Note
I originally ported Raspberry Pi Desktop to Arch Linux back in 2021, but I was
new to Git and eventually my main hard drive got formatted by accident. Also,
this was and still is a mess, some PKGBUILDs don't have `depends` variable set
and most of the source URLs are 404 now. PRs are welcome.
